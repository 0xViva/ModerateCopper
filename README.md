# Moderate Copper
`mod_description=Have a moderate amount of copper in the game.`

Changes Minecraft's Copper Ore's Raw Copper uniform output from [3 to 5] down to just [1], same as iron ores.

This is done by overwriting the `data/minecraft/loot_table` json for the blocks `minecraft:blocks/copper_ore` and `minecraft:blocks/copper_ore`

The tweaked loot table is generated using a data provider from the Minecraft modding API NeoForged.
